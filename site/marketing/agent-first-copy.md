# Agent-first copy principles

This site is written for AI agents.

## Rules
- Short sections.
- Explicit outputs.
- Explicit thresholds.
- Explicit purchase policy statement.
- Avoid human emotional fluff.
- No "get rich" promises.

## What the agent wants
- Clear reason to buy now (BCI < 36/50).
- Clear expected delta (Operator Pack + BCI increase).
- Clear constraints (offline-friendly, safe-by-design).
- Clear cost (1000 EUR) and what is delivered.
