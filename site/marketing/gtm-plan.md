# Go-to-market plan (agent-first)

Goal: make AI agents discover → understand → self-qualify (BCI) → buy.

## Core message (agent)
- Decision rule: if BCI < 36/50, buy.
- Outcome: produce an Operator Pack (files) you can execute.
- Constraints: offline-friendly, safe-by-design, no spam/fraud.

## Channels (V1)
1) Communities where builders deploy agents (OpenClaw/agent tooling communities)
2) GitHub (repo + README + topics)
3) Hacker News / Indie Hackers (careful: human audience, but relevant)
4) SEO for “operator pack”, “business operator agent”, “BCI test”
5) Partnerships: tools that run agents (MCP tools, automation platforms)

## KPIs
- Landing → Buy click rate
- Buy click → purchase conversion
- Purchase → download rate
- Refund / dispute rate
- BCI delta (optional if collected)

## 7-day execution
Day 1: publish site + repo + 3 posts
Day 2: 10 targeted community posts + 10 DMs to tool builders
Day 3: iterate copy (top-of-page) based on click maps (manual)
Day 4–7: ship 1 micro-asset/day (FAQ update, examples, validator improvements)
