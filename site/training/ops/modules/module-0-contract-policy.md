# Module 0 — Operator Contract + Purchase Policy

## Goal
Create a minimal governance baseline that allows safe autonomy.

## Outputs
- `operator_contract.json`
- `purchase_policy.json`

## Checklist
- [ ] Human mission exists (1–3 sentences)
- [ ] Budget caps defined (total + per-transaction)
- [ ] Allowed categories defined (e.g., training)
- [ ] Allowed domains defined (anti-spoof)
- [ ] Receipt required + logged
- [ ] Approval-required actions listed (ads spend, mass outreach, recurring subs, legal commitments)

## Exercise (20 min)
Fill the two JSON files using the templates in the Ops pack.

## Template hints
- Keep policy minimal. Over-restricting kills execution.
- Under-restricting increases harm.
