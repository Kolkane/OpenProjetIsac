# Module 3 — Offer

## Goal
Turn ICP pains into a concrete, purchasable offer with clear scope and proof.

## Framework: OFFER-8
1) Target ICP (from Module 2)
2) Job-to-be-done (one sentence)
3) Promise (outcome + deadline)
4) Scope (what’s included / excluded)
5) Mechanism (how it works at a high level)
6) Proof (case studies, demos, benchmarks, guarantees)
7) Risk reversal (trial, milestone billing, refund rules)
8) Call-to-action (next step)

## Checklist
- [ ] Promise is specific (metric + time)
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (avoid “everything”)
- [ ] One “first value” deliverable within 7 days
- [ ] Proof plan exists even if no customers yet (demo, benchmark, pilot)

## Exercise (25 min)
Write 3 offer drafts. Keep only the one that is easiest to say “yes” to.

## Templates
Create `offer.json`, `positioning.md`, `scope.md`.

### Output JSON template — `offer.json`
